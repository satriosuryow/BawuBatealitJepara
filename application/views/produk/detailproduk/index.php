This is a critical factor, and as such, is probably the most difficult step. For this reason, most people never complete this aspect – then wonder why life is so difficult!</p>

                                    <h6>So why do we do it?</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-4"> The best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your goals in mind and then work. backward to develop the plan. What steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep it with you at all times. Review it regularly and ensure that every step takes you closer to your Vision and Goals. If the plan doesn’t support the vision then change it!</p>
                                    <h6>Does it need to be done at all?</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-4">Along with your plans, you should consider developing an action orientation that will keep you motivated to move forward at all times. This requires a little self-discipline but is a crucial component to achievement of any kind. Before starting any new activity, ask yourself if that activity will move you closer to your goals. If the answer is no, you may want to reconsider doing it at that time.</p>
                                    <h6>Can it be done by someone else?</h6>
                                    <p>The first thing to remember about success is that it is a process – nothing more, nothing less. There is really no magic to it and it’s not reserved only for a select few people. As such, success really has nothing to do with luck, coincidence or fate. It really comes down to understanding the steps in the process and then executing on those steps.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">There are basically six key areas to higher achievement. Some people will tell you there are four while others may tell you there are eight. One thing for certain though, is that irrespective of the number of steps the experts talk about, they all originate from the same roots.</p>
                                    <h6>Can the particular activity be done later?</h6>
                                    <p class="mb-4">What is the exact sequence of events that will take you to where you want to be? Have a think consciously of what you need to do. Every outcome begins with the first step. When you decide you want to have a romantic meal for two, there are many steps that you need to perform in order for that to happen. (Check the fridge, do you have what you want to serve up? No? Find keys, open garage door, drive car to the supermarket etc. etc.) You need to determine the exact sequence of events and write it down. Begin with the outcome in mind. Write without stopping. 10 years from now, I plan to be living in a… at…. With…. Get really detailed about it. Why? Because you are hooking up the neural connections in your brain. You must improve upon, clarify and make clear just exactly who and what you are going to be doing, experiencing, living and having in 10 years. This is the first step of the process! Key: Notice how you felt excited and optimistic when you did this? The reason is simple. It’s the life you are designing instead of the one that was given you and that you have lived with less intention and purpose to date.</p>

One thing for certain though, is that irrespective of the number of steps the experts talk about, they all originate from the same roots.</p>

There is a significant portion of the population here in North America, that actually want and need success to be hard! Why? So they then have a built-in excuse when things don’t go their way! Pretty sad situation, to say the least.</p>

                                        <strong>The best way is to develop and follow a plan.</strong> Start with your goals in mind and then work. backwards to develop the plan. What steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep it with you at all times. Review it regularly and ensure that every step takes you closer to your Vision and Goals. If the plan doesn’t support the vision then change it!

                                    <p class="mb-0">It is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our children. So why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it intentionally or with malice. In the majority of cases, the cause is a well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking parent, who says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple as that!</p>
                                    <p class="mt-2">Commitment is something that comes from understanding that everything has its price and then having the willingness to pay that price. This is important because nobody wants to put significant effort into something, only to find out after the fact that the price was too high.</p>
